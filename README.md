# CodeWars Solutions

I. INTRO:

   1. This Repo is for CodeWars Solutions, utilizing P.R.E.P. technique in resolving the challenges.
      
      a. CodeWarrior Status started as of 2022! 
      
      b. URL: https://github.com/pnkskff/CodeWars-Solutions

   2. Currently working on 8KYU/7KYU/6KYU Javascript Challenges, eventually transitioning into higher KYUs.

   3. Naming Convention for Solutions is:

      a. Solution Number - Kyu - Name.js
   
   4. Unfortunately, the Naming Convention within the Solutions Folders is not supported by Default Github Sort logic:

      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17665267/how-do-you-control-the-order-in-which-files-appear-in-a-github-gist

      Example:
      
         Solution 19 Basic Math Operations.js

         Solution 2 Opposite Number.js

         Solution 20 Returning Strings.js

         Solution 21 Convert Number to Reversed Array of Digits.js

         Solution 3 Num to Str.js

      - Sort logic is Alphabetical as expected, but the double digit numbers append to their root number, instead of being Numerical in Ascending Order.

   5. Solutions are not always the best/most efficient, but it works! - "I'm a baddie and I write bad code. /s"

II. P.R.E.P. TECHNIQUE:

   1. P for Parameters - What are the Parameters of the Challenge?
      
      ex: String or Integers, or both?

   2. R for Return - How is the result expected to show?
      
      ex: Return, Console Log, Alert?

   3. E for Example - Provide an example of the Parameters and the expected Return.
      
      ex: An Integer adding to another Integer, Console Log the Sum.

   4. P for Pseudocode - Type out the step-by-step steps of solving the challenge.
      
      ex:
      
      a. Write a Function
      
      b. Add A to B
      
      c. Console Log Sum

III. NOTE:

1. The Goal of this Repo is to assist Devs in developing consistent habits that will guide them into their Coding journey. 
   - Understanding how to get to the answer is as important as knowing the answer itself.
   - Please do not hesitate to Google, Ask a Dev friend, etc.: Let us learn and teach as a Community!

2. Please use P.R.E.P. when practicing Coding Challenges, as it does build discipline and consistency when thinking through a Challenge!

3. Also, if there is a more efficient or more understandable way of resolving the Challenge: Please Fork/Document/Push, let's build a Repo for all levels of Devs!!!
