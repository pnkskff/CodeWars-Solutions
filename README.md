# CodeWars-Solutions-2022
This Repo is for CodeWars Solutions, utilizing P.R.E.P. technique in resolving the challenges.
Currently doing 8KYU JS Problems, and eventually transitioning into higher KYUs.

P.R.E.P.:

1. P for Parameters - What are the Parameters of the Challenge?
ex: String or Integers, or both?

2. R for Return - How is the result expected to show?
ex: Return, Console Log, Alert?

3. E for Example - Provide an example of the Parameters and the expected Return.
ex: An Integer adding to another Integer, Console Log the Sum.

4. P for Pseudocode - Type out the step-by-step steps of solving the challenge.
ex: 
a. Write a Function
b. Add A to B
c. Console Log Sum

NOTE:

The Goal of this Repo is to help Devs build positive habits that will assist them into their Coding journey - Understanding how to get to the answer is as important as knowing the answer itself.

Please use P.R.E.P. when practicing Coding Challenges, as it does build discipline and consistency when thinking through a Challenge!

Also, if you have a more efficient or more understandable way of resolving the Challenge, please Fork and Push, let's build a Repo for all levels of Devs!
