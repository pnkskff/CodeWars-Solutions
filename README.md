  3. Naming Convention will be:

     a. Solution Number Name.js
     
     b. Eventually, will add Kyu Level: Solution Number Kyu Name.js

II. P.R.E.P. TECHNIQUE:

  1. P for Parameters - What are the Parameters of the Challenge?

III. NOTE:

  1. The Goal of this Repo is to help Devs build positive habits that will assist them into their Coding journey - Understanding how to get to the answer is as important as knowing the answer itself.

  2. Please use P.R.E.P. when practicing Coding Challenges, as it does build discipline and consistency when thinking through a Challenge!

  3. Also, if you have a more efficient or more understandable way of resolving the Challenge: Please Fork and Push, let's build a Repo for all levels of Devs!
