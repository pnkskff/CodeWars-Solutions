# CodeWars Solutions

I. INTRO:

  1. This Repo is for CodeWars Solutions, utilizing P.R.E.P. technique in resolving the challenges.
  
     a. CodeWarrior Status started as of 2022! 

  2. Currently working on 8KYU/7KYU Javascript Challenges, eventually transitioning into higher KYUs.

  3. Naming Convention will be:

     a. Solution/Number/Name.js
     
     b. Eventually, will add Kyu Level: Solution/Number/(Kyu)/Name.js
     
     c. Unfortunately, I am unable to fix the Numerical Sort within the Repo:
     
        Solution 19 Basic Math Operations.js

        Solution 2 Opposite Number.js

        Solution 20 Returning Strings.js

        Solution 21 Convert Number to Reversed Array of Digits.js

        Solution 3 Num to Str.js
     
        - When Sort logic kicks in, the double digit numbers append to their root number.
  
  4. Solutions are not always the best/most efficient, but it works! - "I'm a baddie and I write bad code. /s"

II. P.R.E.P. TECHNIQUE:

  1. P for Parameters - What are the Parameters of the Challenge?

     ex: String or Integers, or both?

  2. R for Return - How is the result expected to show?

     ex: Return, Console Log, Alert?

  3. E for Example - Provide an example of the Parameters and the expected Return.

     ex: An Integer adding to another Integer, Console Log the Sum.

  4. P for Pseudocode - Type out the step-by-step steps of solving the challenge.

     ex: 

     a. Write a Function

     b. Add A to B

     c. Console Log Sum

III. NOTE:

  1. The Goal of this Repo is to assist Devs in developing consistent habits that will guide them into their Coding journey. 
  
      - Understanding how to get to the answer is as important as knowing the answer itself.
      
      - Please do not hesitate to Google, Ask a Dev friend, etc.: Let us learn and teach as a Community!
      
  2. Please use P.R.E.P. when practicing Coding Challenges, as it does build discipline and consistency when thinking through a Challenge!

  3. Also, if there is a more efficient or more understandable way of resolving the Challenge: Please Fork/Document/Push, let's build a Repo for all levels of Devs!!!
